# VRCMods

A Collection of mods for VRChat.

### CalmDown
Simple Mod that disables the Panic button keybind (shift + esc) on desktop, more to come soon.

### ModLoadSeparator
a **Plugin** (goes into `/VRChat/Plugins/`) that lets you load specific mods only on Desktop or VR. It'll create two folders in your Mods folder called `VR` and `Desktop`. <br>
As an example, you'd place IKTweaks into the VR folder, and something like CursorLockFix in Desktop.

## Notice

Modding VRChat is against TOS. I am not held responsible if you get banned for using any of these.
